# TokenizedFinance-Defi-
This is a Decentralized Trading protocol website built using React.js and plain CSS. I have built this website as a practice project with React.js, and since it does not have a backend, so users cannot actually trade anything. However, I will start working on the backend soon.

Do not forget to sign up for our DeFi community on the website.
